# Traffic-Navigation-System
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a Traffic Navigation 
System that calculates the shortest and most efficient path between two given 
locations using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm. This system is built as a practical application of 
graph data structures, enabling students to apply their theoretical knowledge to a 
real-world scenario. Through this project, we aim to understand the use of key data 
structures such as graphs, maps, vectors, stacks, and priority queues in C++. It also 
serves to strengthen our programming and problem-solving skills by simulating the 
core functionality behind modern navigation systems. Additionally, this project 
encourages the development of clean, modular code while reinforcing concepts 
from the Data Structures and Algorithms.
